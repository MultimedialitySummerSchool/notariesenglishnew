                  Ironically, it was the very Sixtus V who forced the paintersâ
                  association to move from the Esquiline in 1588 who was also
                  responsible for the systematic survival of their notarial
                  activity and thus of our new insight into the origins of the
                  Accademia. In 1586 Sixtus intervened radically in the workings
                  of the notarial profession in Rome, which, unlike that of most
                  Italian cities, was double. Civic, or Capitoline, notaries
                  catered to the needs of citizens and prepared court documents
                  for the municipal tribunal located in the Palazzo del
                  Senatore. Curial notaries, many of them foreign, worked
                  instead in the papal bureaus and papal courts that focused on
                  the needs of ecclesiastics. In practice this division was
                  blurry to clients, with laymen using curial notaries and
                  clerics patronizing those of the Capitoline, but the two
                  groups of notaries were indeed distinct because lay and
                  clerical tribunals followed different legal procedures.<a href="/notariesenglishnew/endnotes/#note-25"><sup>25</sup></a>
                  What Sixtus did was to restrict the previously unlimited
                  number of Capitoline notaries to 30 and for the first time
                  sell their offices, thus initiating the process of turning a
                  free and very loosely organized profession into a closed
                  corporation of venal officeholders.<a href="/notariesenglishnew/endnotes/#note-26"><sup>26</sup></a>
                  Fifteen of the newly created notarial offices provided
                  judicial services to each of two civil judges
                  (<em>collaterali</em>) in the Senatorâs tribunal. Over the
                  preceding century, the popes had made all curial notaries
                  venal, so now ownership of notarial offices became the norm in
                  Rome. However, within 25 years, the popes made a unique
                  concession to the Capitoline notaries. In 1612 Paul V granted
                  them the right to bequeath or sell their offices as if they
                  were any other form of property.<a href="/notariesenglishnew/endnotes/#note-27"><sup>27</sup></a>
                  While the actual titleholders of the office had to be
                  notaries, had to expedite their titles through civic
                  officials, and had to be admitted to the new college of
                  notaries of the Capitoline court (<em>notarii curiae capitolii</em>), anyone could purchase the office either in whole or in
                  part and dispose of it freely.

                  In the 50 years between 1583 and 1634 the various paintersâ
                  associations, including guild, confraternity, and academy, as
                  well as the confraternity of stoneworkers in which the
                  sculptors found themselves trapped, employed Capitoline
                  notaries to redact their formal obligations and record
                  payments, receipts, property transfers, inventories, and,
                  importantly, their litigation. Seven notaries worked for the
                  Accademia in these years: Ottaviano, Marco Aurelio, and
                  Alessandro Saravezzi and Giovanni Antonio Moschenio, Erasto
                  Spannocchia, Lorenzo Tigrino, and Tommaso Salvatore. We know
                  their names and can find out who their clients were as a
                  result of Sixtus Vâs imposition of venality on the Capitoline
                  notaries and of Paul Vâs insistence on new archival practices
                  for notarial documents. The period from 1586 to 1612 wrought
                  revolutionary changes in the way in which Roman notaries did
                  their work, and it is no coincidence that the Accademia di San
                  Luca emerges from obscurity in this same arc of time.

                  His <em>signum</em>, the unique logo that Roman notaries used
                  to stamp the first page of their protocols and the public
                  copies of their instruments, identified the Roman-born
                  Ottaviano Saravezzi as a Capitoline notary even before Sixtus
                  Vâs intervention of 1586.<a href="/notariesenglishnew/endnotes/#note-28"><sup>28</sup></a>
                  He had worked for the carpenters and masons in the early 1580s
                  and even joined the carpentersâ confraternity in 1584, the
                  year in which he also made out a receipt for a purchase of
                  wood by the paintersâ guild (<em>universitas</em>).<a href="/notariesenglishnew/endnotes/#note-29"><sup>29</sup></a>
                  For the next 10 years, and then again from 1600 to 1607,
                  Saravezzi continued to produce instruments for the painters,
                  both guild and confraternity, and of course recorded the
                  meeting of March 7, 1593, in which they organized an academy.
                  While dozens of notaries in the ambit of the Capitoline
                  tribunal lost their professional status in 1586, the popeâs
                  new policy permitted Saravezzi to purchase for 500 scudi the
                  notarial office that he had been operating all along, in a
                  sense turning his business into a form of property.<a href="/notariesenglishnew/endnotes/#note-30"><sup>30</sup></a>
                  The property consisted not in the physical space in
                  <em>rione</em> Pigna where his clients found him, but rather
                  in the volumes of protocols containing their contracts and
                  testaments and in the documents of their litigation. Scholars
                  sometimes overlook the revenues that notaries earned from
                  their conduct of lawsuits because they have left such meager
                  traces compared to the business acts in the protocols, but
                  Sixtus V had expected lawsuits to be the lure that would
                  entice notaries to buy their offices. Ottaviano Saravezzi had
                  now become one of 15 Capitoline notaries who produced and
                  filed litigation papers with the second <em>collaterale</em>,
                  one of the four judges in the tribunal of the Senator. Each
                  month he and the other 29 professionals in the college of
                  notaries of the Capitoline court pooled a percentage of their
                  judicial earnings.<a href="/notariesenglishnew/endnotes/#note-31"><sup>31</sup></a>
                  Although his gleanings ranked him in the middle rather than at
                  the top of the group, they prove that clients used him for
                  court papers as well as contracts.<a href="/notariesenglishnew/endnotes/#note-32"><sup>32</sup></a>
                  As Antonia Fioriâs article âThe Cameral Obligation in the
                  Documents of the Accademia di San Lucaâ explains, court
                  notaries were the beating heart of the judicial system. All
                  legal actions started with an appearance before one of them,
                  and they operated with considerable independence since the
                  magistrates trusted them to fill out the summons and warrants
                  (<em>mandati</em>) to which the judges had already put their
                  signatures.
                </p>

                  Venality had an immediate, as well as a long-term, impact on
                  Saravezzi. In 1584 the instruments he produced for his clients
                  in a single year filled one bound volume; seven years later
                  they occupied three volumes. The contraction in the number of
                  city notaries resulted in more business for Saravezzi. In
                  addition, since the acts he rogated for his clients were now a
                  substantial investment, he had a powerful incentive to
                  preserve them carefully. Inventories of the protocols in the
                  possession of the 30 Capitoline notaries document a sea change
                  in the 1580s, with virtually complete series for most offices
                  for the next three centuries. We can get a good idea of the
                  state of conservation of clientsâ acts prior to venality from
                  looking at the stray pre-1580s volumes that survive in some of
                  the 30 offices; these often consist of a hodgepodge of
                  disordered instruments rogated by several different
                  notaries.<a href="/notariesenglishnew/endnotes/#note-33"><sup>33</sup></a>
                  Even more dispiriting is the collection of protocols in the
                  Roman state archive labeled Notai Capitolini (Capitoline
                  Notaries). In actuality this represented an attempt beginning
                  in the 1560s to halt the loss of volumes that occurred when a
                  notary died and his family inherited the little cache of
                  notebooks from which he had made a livelihood. This series,
                  which contains most of what we have in the way of surviving
                  protocols in Rome before 1586, consists largely of those that
                  the authorities managed to capture from the heirs after a
                  notaryâs death. The excessive freedom of the Roman notarial
                  profession before Sixtus V explains why it has been so hard to
                  track the activities of artistsâ associations in earlier
                  decades.

                  A second effect of venality, which showed up gradually from
                  the 1590s on, was to increase the size of the notaryâs
                  workforce. The documents we find in the protocols are rarely
                  in the hand of Ottaviano Saravezzi.<a href="/notariesenglishnew/endnotes/#note-34"><sup>34</sup></a>
                  A titleholder might employ one or two, and by the 1620s
                  perhaps as many as four or five, young men to do much of the
                  actual writing of the office, some authorized as notaries and
                  others mere scribes.<a href="/notariesenglishnew/endnotes/#note-35"><sup>35</sup></a>
                  With the padrone at the head, the notarial office had a
                  hierarchy.<a href="/notariesenglishnew/endnotes/#note-36"><sup>36</sup></a>
                  <em>Sostituti</em> were employees who were official notaries;
                  they had full authority to certify contracts (business acts or
                  instruments) and undertake judicial work, such as taking
                  witness testimony or writing out legal summons.
                  <em>Giovani</em> were the men, usually young, who transcribed
                  the rough notes of transactions into full texts to be kept in
                  the protocols; they had not yet served enough time to qualify
                  for <em>sostituto</em> status or for some reason had not
                  sought it. Giovani also prepared the tables of contents to be
                  inserted into the protocols before they went out for binding,
                  following office practice or their own inclination in
                  determining what name to give to clients. Saravezzi himself
                  attended the important meeting of March 7, 1593, but by the
                  1620s it was much more common to find
                  <em>sostituti</em> documenting academy gatherings. Although
                  there was usually rapid turnover in the staff, some employees
                  remained in a given office for years, even while the
                  titleholder changed. Joseph Palmuctius, for example, who
                  worked in office 15 from 1621 to 1627, spanned the tenure of
                  three Capitoline notaries, Spannocchia, Tigrino, and
                  Salvatore. His name appears frequently as the recorder of
                  meetings of the Accademia in that busy period.<a href="/notariesenglishnew/endnotes/#note-37"><sup>37</sup></a>

                  The increasing number of employees represented growth in the
                  notariesâ business under the impact of venality, but also
                  reflected intensified government regulation of notarial acts.
                  From the middle of the 15th century, Capitoline notaries were
                  required to bind their instruments yearly and put their names
                  on the covers, but rules for notarial writing grew much
                  stricter between 1580 and 1612. New municipal and papal laws
                  demanded that full transcriptions be made within one month
                  (1580),<a href="/notariesenglishnew/endnotes/#note-38"><sup>38</sup></a>
                  that notarial volumes be bound every three months (1612), that
                  an alphabetical table of contents listing the clientâs name
                  and the folio number of the instrument be placed at the
                  beginning of each volume (1612), and that
                  <em>sostituti</em> sign their names at the bottom of the acts
                  they had rogated (1612).<a href="/notariesenglishnew/endnotes/#note-39"><sup>39</sup></a>
                  Most of these measures aimed to protect the integrity of the
                  records against tampering, but they had the corollary effect
                  of making it easier to keep track of them.
