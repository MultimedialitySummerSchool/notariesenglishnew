This essay is part of *The Early History of the Accademia di San Luca, c. 1590–1635: Documents from the Archivio di Stato di Roma*. Initiated in 2010, the project is a collaboration of the National Gallery’s [Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts](https://www.nga.gov/research/center) in association with the Archivio di Stato di Roma and the Accademia Nazionale di San Luca.

Under the direction of interim dean Peter M. Lukehart, *The Early History of the Accademia di San Luca* was conceived in two parts: a [volume of essays concerning the establishment of the Accademia](https://www.nga.gov/research/publications/accademia-seminars-accademia-di-san-luca-rome-c-1590-1635) and a database of rediscovered notarial documents that support current and future study of the Accademia and its members.
